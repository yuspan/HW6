    SHAKESPEARE'S ULTIMATE LESSON IN SOUPMAKING
1ST WITCH: Round about the cauldron go.
 In the poisoned entrails throw.
 Toad, that under cold stone
 Days and nights has thiry-one
 Sweltered venom sleeping got
 Boil thou first i' the charmèd pot.
 ALL: Double, double toil and trouble,
 Fire burn and caldron bubble.
 2ND WITCH: Fillet of a fenny snake,
 In the caldron boil and bake.
 Eye of net and toe of frog,
 Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
 Adder's fork and blindworm's sting,
 Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
 For a charm of powerful trouble,
 Fire burn and caldron bubble.
 ALL: Double, double toil and trouble,
 Fire burn and caldron bubble.
 3RD WITCH: Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
 Witches' mummy, maw and gulf
 of the ravined salt-sea shark,
 Root of hemlock digged i' the dark,
 Liver of blaspheming Jew,
 Gall of goat and slips of yew
 Slivered in the moon's eclipse,
 Nose of Turk and Tatar's lips,
 Finger of birth-strangled babe
 Ditch-delivered by a drab,
 Make the gruel thick and slab.
 Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
 For the ingredients of our caldron.
 ALL: Double, double toil and trouble,
 Fire burn and caldron bubble.
 2ND WITCH: Cool it with a baboon's blood,
 Then the charm is firm and good.
 --Macbeth, IV, 1
